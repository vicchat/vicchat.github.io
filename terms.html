		<h1>vicchat.github.io Privacy Policy and Terms of Service</h1>

		Welcome to the new terms! Please read these terms, they are not too long and shouldn't take up too much time.

		<h3>Privacy Policy</h3>

		vicchat.github.io's privacy policy is simple. We do not use cookies or track you for:

		<ul>
			<li>Advertising (vicchat.github.io is ad-free, and that is the way it will stay!)</li>
			<li>Analytics (I think I spelt that big word correctly)</li>
		</ul>

		We do not use third-party services so your information stays private (sites in Browser Within Browser may still track you). We will use cookies in the following ways:

		<ul>
			<li>Anything you enter in one webpage can be accessed in other ones</li>
			<li>Saving info so it doesn't go away when you leave or reload the page.</li>
			<li>Determining whether you have viewed and accepted to these terms</li>
		</ul>

		vicchat.github.io does not have access to these cookies.<br><br>

		<i>**NOTE: It is not my fault if some hacker dude hacks into this website and tracks your personal information (I did not personally ask them to do it).</i>

		<h3>Terms of service</h3>

		You can use vicchat.github.io freely, and whenever you like, but please keep these guidelines in mind (and try not to go against them):

		<ol>
			<li>This website is supposed to be kind of like a joke, so please don't treat anything that is supposed to be funny here grudgingly. There are a few exceptions, see below</li>
			<li>Please do not say anything mean online, in person to someone, etc. about vicchat.github.io.</li>
			<li>You do not have to download any of the software (like The Random Puffy Thingy and the Big Scary Void Electron Edition) I have made. I only recommend it but if you can't (or don't want to), I don't mind.</li>
			<li>If you are some hacker dude, please please please don't hack this site... hee hee</li>
		</ol>

		Exceptions for number one:
		<ol>
			<li>If you are not Canadian and you don't like the way I spell some words (like colour/color, favourite/favorite, etc) then you have every right to be annoyed</li>
			<li>If English isn't your first language and you are having trouble understanding stuff</li>
			<li>If something you see <i>totally</i> goes against all your beliefs and everything you live for</li>
			<li>You don't have to laugh at anything you see on <i>this</i> webpage</li>
		</ol>

		You don't have to laugh out loud (it's probably not <i>that</i> funny), especially if you are in a public library.<br><br>

		Thank you for reading through these terms! You can now accept them!<br><br>
