		I'm sure you'll find this page rather confusing, due to the cases of it is basically nothing but text, but I do hope this page will find you well because I haven't added anything to vicchat.github.io, and in the meantime I have continued to work on The Random Puffy Thingy and the Big Scary Void and during that time somebody I know has made <a href="https://kooleeo.github.io/">kooleeo.github.io</a>, and I have my website remain unchanged since the addition of The Random Puffy Thingy and the Big Scary Void, except for adding buggy not-legally-approved terms of service, but this is not my blog, in fact I don't event have a blog, so I have no clue why I am typing this but I suppose it will be nice to have something at the bottom of my website other than The Random Puffy Thingy and the Big Scary Void, which hase been there for so long I can't remember when I put it there, and also did you notice I spelt "has" wrong in this run-on sentence which is getting tedious to type, and I don't know if I used the word tedious correctly but I don't care because I wanted to put it in here and I put it here twice.<br><br>
